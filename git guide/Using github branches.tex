\begin{abstract}
This guide was written to explain how to use git (and GitHub) quickly and easily. While it definitely is not a particularly good guide, I couldn't find one online that explained, practically, how to use git with the right context and simply enough. So I wrote this. For an explanation of how Git works (which you \emph{must} know before you read this (knowing ``git commit'', ``git pull'' and ``git push'' or their equivalent GUI buttons dosen't count)) see \href{https://blog.red-badger.com/2016/11/29/gitgithub-in-plain-english}{Git \& Github in plain english} (seriously - do read it).

\section{Branching \& Pull Request Workflow}
This explains a simple workflow, but in extreme detail. A quick outline of this workflow:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create a branch and work on your new changes there
	\item Create a pull request to incorporate changes into master
	\item Review \& approve the pull request, making changes as necessary
	\item Delete the branch
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Creating a branch}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Make sure your git repo is up to date with origin (ie Github) - either by running ``git pull'' or in the GUI clicking the ``Fetch origin'' button
	\item Create the branch by running ``git checkout -b your-branch-name'' or in the GUI going ``Branch \textgreater New Branch'' (also available from the ``current branch'' button next to fetch origin).
	\item Choose a suitable branch name, compliant with relevant conventions/guidelines - it should be short and descriptive. You should create a new branch for every self-contained feature - do NOT create large monolithic branches for miscellaneous updates; even if it means having a branch with just one commit.
	\item Add this branch to origin either by running ``git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-name'' (the extra option connects your new branch to a new reflected branch in origin) or hitting the ``Publish branch'' button in the GUI.

	\item Now you can start working on your feature, updating code, making commits and pushing them up to Github as normal!
\end{enumerate}
